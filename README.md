# OCT_MC  
Monte-Carlo simulation of an FD-OCT A-line or B-Scan.  
  
Description  
Use the most recent version in mcxyz_OCT. In order:

1. You need to use the createSample Matlab file to generate the data for the Monte Carlo simulator.
2. Run the .c code with the newly created files.
3. Use the lookSample to generate the Aline or B-Scan.
  
Note: The simulator was verified to be accurate when using a long focal length (Rayleigth length of 5 mm) for the imaging lens on a single layer sample. Focus needs to be implemented to be accurate with shorter focal length (Rayleigth length of 0.5 mm) however.

===Missing Features / Bugs (to be implemented)===  
-Gaussian beam source  
-Focusing/diverging beams instead of perfectly foccus  
-Customizable surface reflection
-Add the impact of laser coherence  


===Added Features===  
-You can choose the maximum number of photon being process at the same time  
-Added the effect of the likelihood on flux to have a realistic flux with bias scattering  
-Reflection and refraction were added to the code  
-Correction for refractive index due image stretching  
-Making a map of the code  
-Electric filter on the OCT raw A-line  
-The thesis proposed mesh intersection is the same as in St-Jacques code.  
-Corrected the bug in the difference in size from output and input. It was due to the input file not saving all decimals on the dx/dy/dz parameters. 0.00045 became 0.0004.  
-Selecting a_coef as a parameter  
-Fix progress bar of the .c simulation  
-Selecting the number of simulating photons as oppose to time-min.  
-Selecting the number of A-line in the matlab script.  
-Selecting the parameter p  
-Photon path length are now counted in each individual medium.  
-OCT matlab script now allows for taking into account the refractive index impact on the OCT image.  
-Flat noise was added
